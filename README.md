# Report: Exploring Retail Sales Data with Interactive Dashboards in Python

## Introduction:
In this report, we will analyze a Python code used to create a Retail Sales Dashboard. The code uses the Dash framework, which is a powerful tool for creating interactive web-based dashboards. The dashboard will allow the user to visualize sales trends and total sales by store for selected stores.

## Data:
The code uses sales data from a CSV file. The data includes historical sales data for 45 stores, with each store containing a number of departments. The data also includes additional information related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates.

## Code Structure:
The code consists of several parts, including importing necessary libraries and packages, reading the data, and setting up the layout of the dashboard. The code then defines a callback function that updates the figures in the dashboard based on user input. Finally, the code runs the dashboard.

## Code Description:

1. The code first imports pandas, dash, and other necessary libraries.
2. The sales data is read from a CSV file using the pandas read_csv function.
3. The Dash app is initialized with a LUX theme.
4. The layout of the dashboard is set up using HTML and Dash components.
5. The callback function is defined to update the figures in the dashboard based on user input.
6. The figures are created using Plotly graph objects and Plotly express.
7. The figures are returned to the layout.
8. The code runs the dashboard using the run_server method.

## Dashboard Layout:
The layout of the dashboard consists of two main parts. The first part is a dropdown menu that allows the user to select stores to display. The second part consists of two sub-sections. The first sub-section displays the sales trends for the selected stores. The second sub-section displays a pie chart showing the total sales by store.

## Callback Function:
The callback function is defined to update the figures in the dashboard based on user input. The function takes the selected stores as input and returns two figures as output. The first figure displays the sales trends for the selected stores, and the second figure displays a pie chart showing the total sales by store.

## Conclusion:
In this report, we analyzed a Python code used to create a Retail Sales Dashboard using the Dash framework. The dashboard allows the user to visualize sales trends and total sales by store for selected stores. The code uses Plotly graph objects and Plotly express to create the figures, and the layout of the dashboard is set up using HTML and Dash components. The code also defines a callback function that updates the figures based on user input.
